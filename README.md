# The Nix Guide

Welcome to the source repository for [thenix.guide](https://thenix.guide).

## Summary

The Nix Guide is a comprehensive resource for learning about Nix, NixOS, and the Nix ecosystem. It aims to provide clear explanations, practical tutorials, and best practices for users of all skill levels - at least how I understand them.

## Documentation

The documentation content is located in `src/content/docs`. We are continuously working on expanding this guide, so expect many more sections and deep dives to be added in the future.
