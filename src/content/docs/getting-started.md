Nix, like we discussed in the introduction, could mean a lot of things. This guide covers only NixOS, nix-darwin (though I don't actively use this myself anymore), and the nix language itself for usage in various projects.

## NixOS

Installing NixOS is mostly the same as other Linux distros. [Download the ISO](https://nixos.org/download/), burn it to a USB stick, disable secure boot (if you haven't already), boot and install. The download for NixOS can be found later down on the page. I recommend users to use the Graphical ISO image unless you really know what you're doing or have insufficient storage space on the USB stick. This guide won't cover the installation process. Once you've installed NixOS, we can pick up with [Getting Started on NixOS](/nixos/getting-started).
